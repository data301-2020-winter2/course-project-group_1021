Despite it being the 21st century, gender bias is  still present in medicine today. Studies have shown that women are not being offered as advanced diagnostic and treatment options as men. This prejudice has implications on both men and women.    
This is potentially due to a multitude of reasons. For one, women often present symptoms different from men--i.e. a heart attack in women may not present with chest pains and can be similar to flu symptoms, but men present with the classic upper arm pain and chest pressure-- yet traditional medical training is often based on the average patient being a white male. Second, the majority of medical research in history was done on men, and women weren't included in clinical trials until about 1990. With these explanations and more, doctors may not even be aware of gender bias in their practice. 
However, it absolutely exists and may translate to a difference in medical bills as women may have a harder time getting diagnoses. Therefore, our project will aim to investigate the difference in medical bills between men and women with additional factors such as age, BMI, number of children, and region of living all taken under consideration.
