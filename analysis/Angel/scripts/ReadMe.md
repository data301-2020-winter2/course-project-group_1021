# description of script

The purpose of the project_function script is to hold several method chains for my exploration of the dataset. 
Because this dataset is relatively clean and all the columns are useful, I'm not dropping anything. 

The first method chain is just to read the csv file and rename the columns to be consistent with my teammate.

From there on, I'm making a bunch of method chains to create new dataframes
