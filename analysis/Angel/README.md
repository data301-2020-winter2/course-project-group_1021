# Angel's work #
*This file will keep track of Angel's work and notes throughout this project*                           
## Milestone 1 ##
- [x] wrote the description for topic/interest
- [x] set up dataframe
## Milestone 2 ##
- [x] played with markdown
- [x] method chain
- [x] EDA

My dataframe will have a bit of overlap with Ravi's just to get the basic information (such as distribution of men and women in the dataframe and a few distributions)
Looking at our plan, Ravi took care of the simple questions we wrote down so far. So I will work on the complex qs:
1) investigate gender bias by sorting by sex along with another variable
- [x] medical insurance charges between men and women (plot)
- [x] average medical insurance charges between men and women

* Men vs Women
- [x] Age
- [x] # of children
- [x] Smokers
- [x] BMI
- [x] Average for grouped BMI


2) Investigating the highest & lowest charges and their conditions
- [x] Top 50 overall
    - all smokers
    - 29 men vs 21 women
    - mean bmi 37
    - mean # of children 1.28
- [x] Top 10 overall
    - all smokers
    - 6 men vs 4 women
    - mean # of chilren <1
    
- [x] Top 30 men/women
- [x] Bottom 30 men/women
## Milestone 3 ##
- [ ] address feedback
- [ ] make repository public
- [ ] process data for tableau
- [ ] create new release

I addressed the feedback that pertained to what I did in the last milestone which are fixing the "Medical Insurance Charges Distribution between Male and Female Smokers" graph and explaining the dataset I created further.
