# Angel's work #
*This file will keep track of Angel's work and notes throughout this project*                           
## Milestone 1 ##
- [x] wrote the description for topic/interest
- [x] set up dataframe
## Milestone 2 ##
- [x] played with markdown
- [x] method chain
- [x] EDA

My dataframe will have a bit of overlap with Ravi's just to get the basic information (such as distribution of men and women in the dataframe and a few distributions)
Looking at our plan, Ravi took care of the simple questions we wrote down so far. So I will work on the complex qs:
1) investigate gender bias by sorting by sex along with another variable
- [x] medical insurance charges between men and women (plot)
- [x] average medical insurance charges between men and women

* Men vs Women
- [x] Age
- [x] # of children
- [x] Smokers
- [x] BMI
- [x] Average for grouped BMI


2) Investigating the highest & lowest charges and their conditions
- [x] Top 50 overall
    - all smokers
    - 29 men vs 21 women
    - mean bmi 37
    - mean # of children 1.28
- [x] Top 10 overall
    - all smokers
    - 6 men vs 4 women
    - mean # of chilren <1
    
- [x] Top 30 men/women
- [x] Bottom 30 men/women
## Milestone 3 ##
- [x] address feedback
- [x] make repository public
- [x] process data for tableau
- [x] create new release

I addressed the feedback that pertained to what I did in the last milestone which are fixing the "Medical Insurance Charges Distribution between Male and Female Smokers" graphs by making them subplots instead as the overlaying colors were confusing. As well, I went through the entire EDA and further explained some tables and datasets. 

The processed data for tableau did not require anything further than our original "load" function as tableau has filters that would take care of the other functions created. 

## Milestone 4 ##
- [x] created Tableau workbook
- [x] published Tableau workbook
- [x] committed to repository
