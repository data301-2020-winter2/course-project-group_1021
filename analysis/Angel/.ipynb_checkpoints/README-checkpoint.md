*This file will keep track of Angel's work and notes throughout this project*                           
## Milestone 1 ##
- [x] wrote the description for topic/interest
- [x] set up dataframe
## Milestone 2 ##
- [x] played with markdown
- [ ] method chain
- [ ] EDA
### Coordinating with my project partners
    - Ravi's EDA included:
        - distribution of medical charges in the dataframe
        - distribution of ages in the dataframe
        - correlation of age and medical charges
        - mean medical cost for age groups
        - distribution of bmi in the dataframe
        - correlation of bmi and medical charges
        - mean medical costs for bmi groups
        - correlation of number of children and medical charges
        - distribution of charges for smokers
        - distribution of charges for non smokers
        - distribution of sexes
        - distribution of charges for men & women
        - mean medical costs for men and women
        - trend of medical costs as age increases
        - place of residence vs medical charges
        
### My Plan
#### Pre exploration Plan
My dataframe will have a bit of overlap just to get the basic information (such as distribution of men and women in the dataframe and a few distributions)
Looking at our plan, Ravi took care of the simple questions we wrote down so far. So I will work on the complex qs:
    - investigate gender bias by sorting by sex along with another variable
    - the rate of change as individuals age?
    - What happens if we look at people with all the same conditions except 1?
